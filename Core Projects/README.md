## Foundation Layer — Core Python Systems
---
---
## Overview
---
This directory contains foundational systems built using pure Python.
The purpose of this layer is not to create isolated mini-projects, but to develop strong core programming fundamentals before moving into databases, data analytics, statistics, and machine learning.
This is the base layer of a long-term engineering roadmap.

## Objective

- Build deep competence in:
- Data structures
- Clean function design
- Object-Oriented Programming
- File handling (CSV / JSON)
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Modular system architecture
- Code readability and refactoring
- No external libraries are used at this stage.

The goal is to master logic before relying on tools.

## Why This Layer Exists

Advanced systems fail when foundations are weak.
- Before building:
- Data pipelines
- SQL-based architectures
- Statistical models
- Machine learning systems
- APIs and deployable products
- Core Python must be structurally solid.

This layer ensures:
- Algorithmic clarity
- Structured thinking
- System design habits
- Discipline in writing maintainable code

## Engineering Principles Followed

Incremental development
Clean commit history
Modular design
Separation of concerns
Meaningful naming conventions
Refactoring over rewriting

## The progression path:

1. Core Python Systems
2. SQL & Database Architecture
3. Data Analysis & Visualization
4. Statistical Modeling
5. Machine Learning
6. API & Product Deployment

This directory represents Phase 1 of that roadmap.
