# Text Analyzer

## Overview

Text Analyzer is a command-line based text analysis tool built using pure Python (no external libraries).

The program takes a paragraph as input and extracts structured insights such as word count, sentence count, word frequency, and basic sentiment analysis.

This project focuses on strengthening core Python fundamentals and logical thinking required for data science.

## Objective

To build a mini text-processing engine from scratch using:

- Strings
- Loops
- Dictionaries
- Conditionals
- Functions
- File handling (optional extension)

---

## Features

- Convert text to lowercase
- Remove punctuation
- Count total words
- Count total sentences
- Calculate word frequency
- Identify most frequent word
- Remove stopwords (custom defined)
- Basic sentiment scoring

## Tech Stack

- Python (Core only)
- No external libraries

---

## How It Works

1. User enters a paragraph of text.
2. The program cleans the text (lowercase, remove punctuation).
3. Text is split into words.
4. Word frequency is calculated using dictionaries.
5. Stopwords are removed.
6. Sentiment score is calculated using predefined positive and negative word lists.
7. Results are displayed in structured format.

## Concepts Practiced

- String manipulation
- Data cleaning
- Dictionary operations
- Loop optimization
- Edge case handling
- Writing modular functions

## Future Improvements

- Use file input instead of manual input
- Store results in a file
- Use pandas for structured analysis
- Add visualization using matplotlib
- Integrate with SQL database
- Apply NLP libraries (NLTK / spaCy)
- Build a web interface
