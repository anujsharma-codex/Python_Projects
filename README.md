## Overview
---
This repository contains structured Python projects built to strengthen core programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills.
The focus is on writing clean, modular, and logical code without relying heavily on external libraries.
These projects form the foundation for future work in data science and software development.

## fundamentals/

Contains mini projects focused on practicing specific Python concepts such as:
- String manipulation
- List operations
- Duplicate handling
- Menu-driven program structure
- Function modularity

## core_projects/

Contains larger structured projects that integrate multiple programming concepts into more complete systems.

## Skills Practiced

- Function design and modular programming
- Data cleaning logic
- String and list manipulation
- Control flow and loops
- Manual duplicate elimination
- Basic preprocessing techniques

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to build strong Python fundamentals before progressing to:
- NumPy & Pandas
- Data analysis projects
- Machine learning workflows
- Real-world dataset exploration

## Roadmap

Upcoming additions:
- File handling projects
- CSV data preprocessing
- Exception handling systems
- Unit testing integration
